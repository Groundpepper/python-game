# Total-War

2 July 2021
I am attempting to create a WWII simulation game focused on strategy surrounding purchasing, placing units and attacking. The game works similar to D&D, wherein major decisions are decided via dice rolls. Currently I have 2 days of work uploaded onto this repository. I am not certain about how often I should upload on Github. After this update, I will work on making the units appear on the dot map I created. I plan to eventually incorporating this game to a website of some sort with HTML as its front stack lang.
